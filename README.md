# Project 4: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This is my fourth assignment project for the UCI Coding Bootcamp.

This website is a coding quiz in which the user is able to test their knowledge of basic JavaScript concepts. They are able to see their score in terms of how much time they have left by the end of the quiz. They are able to store this score on their local machine.

The purpose of this project website is to demonstrate the use of functions and logic in JavaScript, as well as the use of local storage to store user data.

Working on this project helped me learn how to create a website that is responsive to user input. It also helped me learn how to implement local storage in order to store the user's scores from the quiz.

This is my fifth assignment project for the UCI Coding Bootcamp.

This website is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm).

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

Working on this project helped me learn the basics of using jQuery, as well as how to use an API. I also learned how to use the "this" keyword in JavaScript.
